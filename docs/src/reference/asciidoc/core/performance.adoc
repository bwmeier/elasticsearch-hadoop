== Improving performance

TODO
- mention that hardware needs to be looked at and many times adding more hw is simply the answer. However below are some tips to get good performance - that is the most out of the existing infrastructure.

- increase network buffer size
- number of mappers/reducers
- use mapper/streaming mainly
- use a reducer to limit the number of writes
- pay attention to network I/O
- pay attention to memory usage
- disable replicas (when loading a lot of data)
- consider using snapshot/restore
