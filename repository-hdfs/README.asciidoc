== Hadoop HDFS Snapshot/Restore plugin

+elasticsearch-repository-hdfs+ plugin allows Elasticsearch 1.0 to use +hdfs+ file-system as a repository for http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/modules-snapshots.html[snapshot/restore]. See http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/introducing-snapshot-restore/[this blog] entry for a quick introduction to snapshot/restore.

== Requirements
- Elasticsearch (version *1.0* or higher)
- hdfs accessible file-system (from the Elasticsearch classpath)

== Flavors
The HDFS snapshot/restore plugin comes in three flavors:

Default / Hadoop 1.x:: The default version contains the plugin jar alongside Hadoop 1.x (stable) dependencies.
Yarn / Hadoop 2.x:: The +yarn+ version contains the plugin jar plus the Hadoop 2.x (Yarn) dependencies.
Light:: The +light+ version contains just the plugin jar, without any Hadoop dependencies.

=== Which version to use?
It depends on whether you have Hadoop installed on your nodes or not. If you do, then we recommend exposing Hadoop to the Elasticsearch classpath (typically through an environment variable - see the Elasticsearch http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.x/setup-configuration.html[reference] for more info) and using the +light+ version. This guarantees the existing libraries and configuration are being picked up by the plugin.
If you do not have Hadoop installed, then select either the default version (for Hadoop stable/1.x) or, if you are using Hadoop 2, the +yarn+ version.

== Installation
As with any other plugin, simply run:
+bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/elasticsearch-repository-hdfs/1.3.0.M2+

When looking for +light+ or +yarn+ artifacts use:
+bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/elasticsearch-repository-hdfs/1.3.0.M2-<classifier>+

To install the latest snapshot, please install the plugin manually using:
+bin/plugin -u <url-path-to-plugin.zip> -i elasticsearch-repository-hdfs-1.3.0-BUILD-SNAPSHOT+

NOTE: 1.3.0 M2 has not been released yet, please install the plugin manually

=== Development Snapshot
Grab the latest nightly build from the http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-repository-hdfs/[repository] again through Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
  <artifactId>elasticsearch-repository-hdfs</artifactId>
  <version>1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>sonatype-oss</id>
    <url>http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----

== Configuration Properties

Once installed, define the configuration for the +hdfs+ repository through +elasticsearch.yml+ or the REST API:

[source]
----
repositories
  hdfs:
    uri: "hdfs://<host>:<port>/"    # optional - Hadoop file-system URI
    path: "some/path"               # required - path with the file-system where data is stored/loaded
    load_defaults: "true"           # optional - whether to load the default Hadoop configuration (default) or not
    conf_location: "extra-cfg.xml"  # optional - Hadoop configuration XML to be loaded
    conf.<key> : "<value>"          # optional - 'inlined' key=value added to the Hadoop configuration
    concurrent_streams: 5           # optional - the number of concurrent streams (defaults to 5)
    compress: "false"               # optional - whether to compress the data or not (default)
    chunk_size: "10mb"              # optional - chunk size (disabled by default)
----

NOTE: Be careful when including a paths within the +uri+ setting; Some implementations ignore them completely while others consider them. In general, we recommend keeping the +uri+ to a minimum and using the +path+ element
instead.

== Plugging other file-systems

Any HDFS-compatible file-systems (like Amazon +s3://+ or Google +gs://+) can be used as long as the proper Hadoop configuration is passed to the Elasticsearch plugin. In practice, this means making sure the correct Hadoop configuration files (+core-site.xml+ and +hdfs-site.xml+) and its jars are available in plugin classpath, just as you would with any other Hadoop client or job.
Otherwise, the plugin will only read the _default_, vanilla configuration of Hadoop and will not be able to recognized the plugged in file-system.
